    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points
    of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for
    information.
    <dl>
      <dt>by Subject</dt>
      <dd>
        A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.
      </dd>
      <dt>by type</dt>
      <dd>
        Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find
        things if you know what you are looking for.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the
    subject list. See also: About the W3 project.
