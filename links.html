    <h1>Hypertext Terms</h1>
    <p>
      This is a glossary of terms used within the
      <a href="hts project.html">WWW</a> project. In most cases, their use
      corresponds to converntional use in hypertext circles.

      <dt>Anchor</dt>
      <dd>
        An area within a the content of a <a href="links.html">node</a> which is
        the source or destination of a <a href="links.html">link</a> . The
        anchor may be the whole of the node content. Typically, clicking a mouse
        on an anchor area causes the link to be followed, leaving the anchor at
        the opposite end of the link displayed. Anchors tend to be highlighted
        in a special way (always, or when the mouse is over them), or
        represented by a special symbol. An anchor may, and often does,
        correspond to the whole node. (also sometimes known as "span", "region",
        "button", or "extent").

      <dt>Annotation</dt>
      <dd>
        The linking of a new commentary node to an existing
        <a href="links.html">node</a>. If readers can annotate nodes, then they
        can immediately provide feedback if the information is misleading, out
        of date or plain wrong. Thus the quality of the information in the
        <a href="links.html">web</a>
        can be improved. <a href="more.html">(More...)</a>
        There is a specific problem which all distributed hypertext systems have
        had to tackle, in linking to living documents.
