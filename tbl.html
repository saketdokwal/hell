    <h1>WWW people</h1>
    This is a list of some of those who have contributed to the WWW project ,
    and whose work is linked into this web. Unless otherwise stated they are at
    CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below or look them up in the
    phone book . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland. See also: Wizards at SLAC
    .
    <h2>Eelco van Asperen</h2>
    Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
    version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
    <h2>Carl Barker</h2>
    Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at Brunel
    University, UK. Carl will be working on the server side, possibly on client
    authentication. Tel: 8265. Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
    <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among other
    things, document production and text processing. He developped his first
    hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although unaware of
    the existence of the term HyperText). With a background in text processing,
    real-time software and communications, Tim decided that high energy physics
    needed a networked hypertext system and CERN was an ideal site for the
    development of wide-area hypertext ideas. Tim started the
    <a href="www.html">WorldWideWeb</a>
    project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the application on the NeXT along with
    most of the communications software. Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
    <h2>Robert Cailliau</h2>
    Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction, Robert
    has been interested in document production since 1975, when he designed and
    implemented a widely used document markup and formatting system. He ran
    CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89. He is a long-time user
    of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse ends as writing trip reports,
    games, bookkeeping software, and budget preparation forms. When he is not
    doing WWW's public relations, Robert is contributing browser software for
    the Macintosh platform, and analysing the needs of physics experiments for
    online data access. Phone: +41 (22) 767 50 05, Email:
    cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
    <h2>Dan Connoly</h2>
    An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor for
    his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in the future.
    He wrote a DTD for HTML and an HTML legalizer for old files. Email:
    connolly@pixel.convex.com.
    <h2>Peter Dobberstein</h2>
    While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE), Peter did the port of the line-mode
    browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the most difficult of
    the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental problems in making a
    large amount of information in the DESY database available.
    <h2>"Erwise" team</h2>
    Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka ('{' is
    'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set description into
    HTML!) (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke) are "Erwise". At Helsinki
    Technical University, they are writing a Motif-based WWW browser (editor? we
    can hope...) for their undergraduate final year project. The team can be
    reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari as arl@cs.hut.fi.
    <h2>Alain Favre</h2>
    Alain is an undergraduate working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows on
    PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet. In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
    <h2>David Foster</h2>
    With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
    systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having a go at a
    MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest in server
    technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
    <h2>Jean-Francois Groff</h2>
    Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay at CERN
    as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991. He wrote the
    gateway to the VMS Help system , worked on the new modular browser
    architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels. He is now
    porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set up servers for
    physics experiments. JF now works for NeXT Europe but continues his interest
    in the web...( Contact )
    <h2>Tony Johnson</h2>
    Tel: (415) 926 2278, TONYJ@scs.slac.stanford.edu. Designer of MidasWWW .
    Boston University, collaborating with SLAC, SSC, etc. A SLAC server expert
    and a WWWizard .
    <h2>Paul Kunz</h2>
    Paul took the W3 word across to SLAC, installed the clients and inspired the
    setting up of servers by the WWWizards . Paul spreads enthusiasm for all
    sort of good ideas such as OO programming, NeXTs, etc...
    <h2>William Van Leeuvan</h2>
    at NIKHEF, WIllem put up many servers and has provided much useful feedback
    about the w3 browser code.
    <h2>Nicola Pellow</h2>
    With the project from November 1990 to August 1991, and October 1992 to ??.
    A graduate of Leicester Polytechnic, UK, Nicola wrote the original line mode
    browser . ( More ) Nicola is now (Oct 92) working on the Mac browser .
    <h2>Bernd Pollermann</h2>
    Bernd is responsible for the "XFIND" indexes on the CERNVM node, for their
    operation and, largely, their contents. He is also the editor of the
    Computer Newsletter (CNL), and has experience in managing large databases of
    information. Bernd is in the AS group of CN division. He has contributed
    code for the FIND server which allows hypertext access to this large store
    of information. Phone: 2407, Office: 513-1-16, Email: bernd@cernvm.cern.ch
    <h2>A r thur Secret</h2>
    A student at CERN during August and September 1992, Arthur wrote the first
    W3-Oracle gateway .
    <h2>Jonthan Streets</h2>
    Online Support group, FNAL. Jonathan put up a VMS server using DCL and later
    C. He helped debug the Mac browser.
    <h2>Pei Wei</h2>
    Pei is the author of " Viola", a hypertext browser, and the ViolaWWW variant
    which is a WWW browser. He was at the University of California at Berkeley,
    Experimental Computing Facility, now full time with O'Reilly and Associates,
    Sebastopol, CA, USA. Email: wei@xcf.berkeley.edu
    <h2>Bebo White</h2>
    one of the WWWizards at SLAC, Bebo enthusiastically spreads the word. During
    a short stay at CERN in summer '92, Bebo put up a number of servers for
    information from the Aleph experiment.
